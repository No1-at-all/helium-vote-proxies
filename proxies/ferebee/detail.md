## Experience

Helium maximalist since 2020 with IOT deployments in Europe since 2021. Dropped out of cryptography studies in the â€™90s. Author of HIP-76 (passed) and HIP-80 (failed). Spends too much time on Discord and Twitter keeping up with developments.

## Voting Philosophy

Will vote on all proposals in all Helium subnetworks, focusing on the long-term success of Helium as a whole. Proper governance can align the incentives of individual participants, so we can rule the world together with the 10x capex/opex efficiency advantage of decentralized infrastructure. DePIN is Helium.
