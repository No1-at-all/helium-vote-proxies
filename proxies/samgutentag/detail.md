## Experience

I have been directly involved in the Helium Network since 2021 as a network builder, deploying IOT and MOBILE Hotspots, and (formerly) as an employee of both Nova Labs and the Helium Foundation.

## Voting Philosophy

I will vote based on the data, with an intention to benefit each network(s) by focusing not on the direct benefit to each individual installation, but rather the network as a whole. As the needs of the network(s) change, and the direction of the community adapts, the network(s) will be pushed in new directions. I am not afraid to pursue "old ideas" and will retrod ground as often as is necessary to ensure the network(s) progress.
