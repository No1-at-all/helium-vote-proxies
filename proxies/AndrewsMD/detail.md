## Experience

Having been in the Helium Community since 2021, coupled with deploying both IoT and Mobile hotspots, I have long term vested interests in Helium’s Ecosystem.  Some may consider me a large deployer, but I say,... larger than some, but not as large as others.

My economic interests are aligned with Helium’s long term success.  This is evidenced by, but not limited to:
1)    Sizable personal and corporate 4 year lock ups of veHNT, veIoT, and veMobile;
2)    The amount of financial exposure my family has to this project; and,
3)    The amount of infrastructure that I have built and continue to build for the network.

## Voting Philosophy

My votes align with long term economic interests of the network, and that which facilitates continuous reliable DC burn by solving real world problems.
