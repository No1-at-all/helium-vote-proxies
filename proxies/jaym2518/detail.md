# Jay M.

I go by @jaym2518 on Discord and [X](https://x.com/jaym2518).

## Experience

I began deploying Helium coverage in 2019 and have been an active member of this and other DePIN communities. Currently serving a second term on the Mobile Working Group, where I co-authored HIPs 103 and 125 and help mentor fellow deployers. IRL background in U.S. governance (federal, state and local).

## Voting Philosophy

Taking a thoughful and collaborative approach to designing our reward structures so they align with the needs of the network, and iterating to make those approaches continue to work as the network evolves. In the end, the health, growth, and sustainability of the network always comes first.
