I go by @Lnjenkins on Discord.

## Experience

I began deploying Helium (IoT) coverage in February of 2022 and MOBILE coverage in starting in April of 2022. I have deployed over 125 CBRS radios and over 100 WiFi hotspots for various clients as an installer from the largest deployer down to roof of my own local firehouse. Many individuals have called me from Helium Deploy’s deployer database and I am glad to help out. I am currently serving on the Mobile Working Group, where I am helping Helium grow and become a successful neutral host Carrier’s value.

## Voting Philosophy

I strongly believe DePIN networks are the way of the future. I vote to consistently shape the Helium 5G Mobile network to be attractive and of value to service providers. I see the goal of the network to be open and available to everyone as a neutral host at a fair price with fair rewards.
